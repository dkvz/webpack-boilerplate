See sections below for info about how to add specific elements to the project.

## Usage
After running `npm install` to install the dependencies, you can start a dev server like so:
```
npm run dev
```

To build and minify for prod. in the dist directory, use:
```
npm run prod
```

You can also have the dev server bind all the IP addresses on your machine by using:
```
npm run dev-bind-all
```
